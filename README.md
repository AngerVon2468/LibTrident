# LibTrident

#### What if you wanted to Trident, but Mojank said: "You need a stupid amount of Mixins for that!"

Once complete, this library will allow simple creation of custom tridents, without the need to add Mixins
that might potentially break when applied against other mods.

Currently targeted at Fabric 1.20.1, but I'll port it to other versions later.
